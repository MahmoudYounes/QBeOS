# Overview
PCI Bus is replacing ISA Buses due to its higher speed and bandwidth in data
transformaiton. it is a bus with independent microcontroller and data connection
that arbitrates an amount of connected devices and allows them to interrupt the CPU

CONFIG_ADDRESS: 0xcf8 ioport  specifies the address to be accessed
CONFIG_DATA   : 0xcfc ioport  generates the config access and will transfer data
                              to and from CONFIG_DATA register
