# multiprocessing
this section deals with running multiprocessors together.

## MP Bootprotocol
One of the logical processors is selected as the bootstrap processor (BSP) and the others are marked as application processors (AP).
This configuration is defined in the APIC tables. The BSP executes MP initialization code and boots the OS. The AP executes minimal
initialization code until it recieves a self inter processor interrupt message (SIPI) which ends up with the processor in HALT state
and ready to be interrupted.

// placeholder for now
processor initialization should happen before system interrupts are enabled???
