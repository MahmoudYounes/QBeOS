# Overview
the pic is the predecure of the APIC. it supports only 16 interrupts and works
as a master and slave chips. we are only allowed to define 15 external interrupts
because the master has one interrupt line wired to the slave.

if APIC is to be used then pic needs to be disabled.
we configure the PIC with writing words of configurations.

one distinction to be made here is that there is a difference between the 
processor interrupts and the external interrupts. processor interrupts are the
ones generated by the processor to itself. something like the syscalls and 
the architectural exceptions generated by the processor for itself.
the external interrupts are the interrupts that are generated for the processor
by another chip in the system. ex: the timer interrupts or the keyboard interrupts
so essentialy all HID (Human input devices) generate an interrupt to the CPU 
and are called external interrupts.
