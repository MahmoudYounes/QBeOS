# QBeOS components and dir structure

QBeOS kernel (QBeKern) : /src : c++
QBeOS bootloader (QBeL) : /boot : assembly NASM

QBeOS will only be iso bootable. ISO 9660 will be the first "semi-supported" fs.
This allows 2046 bytes bootloader; a 2kb boot loader to be loaded!! maybe no need for 2 stages?
we will see.

# Bootloader
## real mode memory addressing
- segmentAddr << 4 + offset 
- when storing address in label in nasm, when using this address in a mov operation
the above equation does not apply. the correct way to move data in this case is to
load es with label address and load di with the desired offset and then use
stos(b,w,d,q) to store the data in there.
remember [<label/register>] is like *label/*register in c/c++

## List of important assumptions made
* the kernel and bootloader exist both in the root directory. There are no other directories on the CD

## qbeos bootloader
the bootloader in boot directory contains all assembly files required to build the bootloader. NASM is used for this task.
the main file bootloader.asm contains all required files and is the main entry to the bootloader. inside this file, other files
are imported that holds other functionalities.

## qbeos bootloader kernel boot params
qbeos BL passes a specific set of params to the kernel it is booting. these params are organized as the following.
TODO: if a requirement rises that requires this implement it. otherwise delete the TODO.

# QBeOS Kernel

the output of this module is the KERNEL.IMG binary file.

## Important
.. keep this here. important learning
I have discovered that if I want to write a kernel that is bigger than 400KBs (conventional memory available below 1Mib Boundry)
I need to load it into memory beyond the 1Mib boundry. in real mode, beyond the 1Mib boundry only 64Kbs available so that means
the size of my kernel can't be bigger than 464Kbs. at the time of writing this, my basic, not so good, kernel that only writes
stuff to screen is 1.2Kb. I have naively thought I could trick the BIOS bytes setting the pointer to the buffer where the
kernel is loaded to the 1Mib boundary exactly, hoping the BIOS will be able to do so itself (i.e, access memory beyond 1Mib +
64Kb) but the BIOS was.. well.. smarter or dumber than me.. eventually I researched osdev and found out that BIOS is not reliable in loading
stuff above 1Mib, but I can load below 1Mib and relocate data there.

so taking a pause here to evaluate these two decisions:

* Continue as I am now, and leave this problem for future me.
**Changes:
*** I will restructure the memory layout to load the kernel in a lower address.

** Pros:
*** short - no changes really
*** get to the good stuff (the actual OS things)

** Cons:
*** may struggle when I hit the limits of the 1Mib memory while loading the kernel

* Implement a solution for this.
**Changes:
*** to talk to higher memroy I need to be in protected mode. When I am in protected mode, I will not be able to use BIOS
    Interrupts which means I will not be able to load the kernel while in real mode before jumping to protected mode. That means,
    to load the kernel I will have to jump to protected mode and load the kernel via a driver. this is already smelling like 2
    stage bootloader.

# Virtual Memory management
The essential objective of virtual memory management is to implement how addresses are
translated and memory access control. There are three types of addresses into
memory.
Virtual address(AKA logical address), linear address, physical address.
At the end of the day physical address is the address used to access the memory.
If we have a flat memory model, i.e, GDT: Code Segment == Data Segment == The
whole memory (this is set by having 2 GDT entries spanning the whole
memory limits), then Virtual address is the same as a linear address.
This is because linear address is produced from virtual address by means of
segmentation. The virtual address consists of 16 bit selector and 32 bit offset.
The selectors are selectors into the GDT or LDT depending on the context.
LDT is associated with tasks. When in flat memory model, the selectors
are preloaded during boot after switching to protected mode from real mode.
The physical address is calculated from the linear address via paging. the linear
address is split into 10 10 12 bits. The first 10 bits point into page directory.
it is the index of a page directory entry. A page directory entry then points to
a page table. The second 10 bits point into the index of a page table entry.
A page table entry points to the start of a page in physical memory. the last 12
bits is the index of the byte in the page. That means each page can be 4096 byte
or 4kbs.
Likewise, if paging is disabled then Virtual address maps to linear address via
the GDT and linear address in this case is the same as physical address.

In conclusion, segmentation and paging are two different memory protection modes.
They can be used together or one can be used and not the other. Segemntation can
be used to isolate tasks in a multitasking or multiprocess environments. The
latter is the environment you get when the CPU has multicores. Segmentation is
deprecated so in QBeOS we use a flat memory model. We will only protect kernel
code and data memory space.


Note: All of this information can be found in intel manuals Vol3 Chapter 3.

# QBeOS Memory Management model
Right after the bootloader is done and before jumping to the kernel, the memory
model is flat memory model. i.e, both code and data descriptors in GDT map to
the whole available memory address space.

QBeOS for the time being is 32 bit OS (TODO: Switch to 64 bits)

After booting, QBeOS defines 4 segments in GDT spanning the whole memory, 2 for
kernel code and data, and 2 for user code and data + 1 null descriptor:
index          | Base           | LIMIT         | Description
0              | 0              | 0             | null descriptor
1              | 0x00000000     | 0xFFFFF       | executable kernel code
2              | 0x00000000     | 0xFFFFF       | nonexecutable kernel data
3              | 0x00c00000     | 0xFFFFFF      | user executable
4              | 0x00c00000     | 0xFFFFFF      | user data

The purpose of this segmentation model is just to protect kernel area from user
area. We will rely also on paging to protect kernel and user code from each other as well.
GDT will be used for LDT and TSS as well.

# MemoryManager
the memory manager (Memory:memory.h) is responsible for the physical memory. The memory manager is just that
a memory manager.
Memory is initialized by reading the memory tables placed by the bootloader at 0x70000.
It then splits the memory into physical pages.
Each page will be of size PAGE_SIZE(4k).
Post initialization, Memory marks the pages used by the kernel as reserved.

Memory Public API (Size is in bytes):
AllocPhysicalPage(): searches for the first free page and allocates it. return pointer to base of page
Allocate(size): allocates X + (X + PAGE_SIZE) % PAGE_SIZE pages and returns pointer to first page.
Free(pagePointer): given a page pointer that begins on the page boundary, free the string of pages marked with allocation ID.

# VirtualMemory and virtual memory management
QBeKern will place PDT entries starting address 0x2500000. In 32 bit mode we have 2 levels only (PDT, PT) each is 1024 entries.
each entry is 8 bytes so ideally 16KBs should be sufficient for such tables. However, in 64 bits long mode, we need to expand
this memory requirement to include a max of 5 levels (5 * 1024 * 8 = 40KBs).
Since QBeKern is 32 bits for now, we will stick with only 2 levels of page tables. Once paging is enabled, even the kernel
memory locations will be accessed via MMU.
QBeKern should be, at some point, a higher half kernel. That means on 32 bits we map the kernel starting address 0xc0000000. For
now, the kernel and all of its everything exist in the lower 8MBs of the kernel.
There will be two stages for paging to avoid issues.
* First 8MBs of virtual address will point to first 8MBs of physical addresses.
* First 8MBs after 0xc0000000 will point to first 8MBs of physical addresses.
* Paging Enabled, jump absolute (jmp <from reg>)
* First 8MBs gets unmapped to zero.
if memory is 4GBs (Max on 32 bits), 1024 PDTEntries with, 1024 PTEntries
every PDTEntry is 32bits and each PTEntry is 32bits
That's PDT Size = 1024 * 32 = 4096 bytes (4kb)

# MSRs
model specific registers (MSR) are registers defined per cpu model. you can use  RDMSR and WRMSR commands, ax dx to fill in data
and you provide the instruction with MSR address. list of all MSRs with addresses and functionalities found in intel vol4 chapter 2.

# Interrupts in life and QBeKern

## Interrupts handler vs interrupts delivery
There is a distinction between the interrupts handlers which are defined via the lidt command and the handlers code, and the
interrupt delivery mechanism, which is the chip (PIC vs LAPIC and IOAPIC) and the configuration for these chips.

## Interrupts in life
Interrupts are events that causes the CPU to stop whatever it is doing and service them. Interrupts service 3 purposes:
* informing the kernel there is an Exception that happened (page faults, double faults, general protection fault, etc.)
* informing the kernel there is a hardware that wants to send/recieve data (hardware interrupt generated externally)
* informing the kernel there is a process that requires its attention via system call (software interrupts).

## Architecturly defined interrupts
A system using intel x86 ia32 arch can handle [0, 255] interrupts. The first 32 interrupts [0, 31] interrupts are
reserved by the arch developers. They are used to signal internal CPU exceptions. The system developer must write
the necessary code to do the handling.
to get a list of all the arch defined interrupts, see the intel reference manual in repo section 6-2 vol. 3A

## From a hardware prespective
### PIC: Programmable interrupt controller
on x86 architecture the hardware interrupts are handled via an external chip named PIC. this has a layout of a
master and slave chip. Each chip provides 8 interrupts but a total of 15 interrupts can be handled becuase there is
one interrupt line to connect the master chip with the slave chip.
This chip is a legacy chip since the intel apic and ioapic came out in the early pentiums.
PIC serves only external hardware generated interrupts. the PIC hardware generated interrupt handlers start at 0x30

## APIC: Advanced programmable interrupt controller
This is the next generation succeeding PIC. This is used for more sophisticated interrupt redirection mechanisms and
allows CPUs interrupting each other.
This is a necessity in SMP/SIMD envs.

There are two components of the APIC, an on chip APIC called local APIC and an IO APIC that is attached to the
system bus. The local APIC is attached to a cpu core and responsible for signals comming to this CPU. The IO APIC is
part of the chipset, and provides multiprocessor interrupt management. we have 1 APIC per cpu core and one IO APIC
for the whole chipset.

For each CPU Core, the local APIC is connected to pins LINT[1:0]. When the APIC is disabled these pins serve as
INTR and NMI pins. When the APIC is enabled, these pins can be programmed to remap the interrupts.

The processor may recieve interrupts from the local APIC which is connected to the external devices like,
other devices such as Keyboard, GPU, etc. or the IO APIC.

local and IO APIC can be programmed via registers that are memory mapped. the area of memory they are mapped to is FEE00000H.
this area must be designated to the processor as strongly unchachable. the registers are 128-bit aligned though not all of them
are 128bits in size. all memory stores should be 32-bit memory store commands.

to enable the APIC or disable it, we use the MSR register IA32_APIC_BASE[11] set it to 0 to disable to enable it again a system
reset has to occur. it can be set to 1 but the spurious register is cleared which puts the APIC in a specific state in which it is
disabled but.... using this way can all the apic to be renabled later.

These are the interrupt sources:
* interrupt on pins LINT0 LINT1 which resembles the interrupts recieved on the PIC.
* interrupt from IO APIC: this is called external interrupt source, the rest is called local interrupt source.
* interrupt from other processors AKA inter process interrupt (IPI)
* interrupt from APIC timer: a timer can be programmed every x period (useful for scheduling processes?)
* interrupt from performance counters
* interrupt from thermal sensors
* interrupt from local apic errors
every interrupt source has an associated vector to it. it also has a mask bit that can disable a specific interrupt source.

to program the APIC you need to interface with it via memory read/writes. check table 11.1 - Local APIC Register address map in
intel manual.

we use IA32_APIC_BASE MSR register to understand the current status and where the registers of APIC are mapped.
IA32_APIC_BASE[8]: signals if the processor is the boot processor (every processor has its own MSR registers)
IA32_APIC_BASE[11]: global enable/disable APIC
IA32_APIC_BASE[12..35]: contains the 24 bit high part of the memory address where the APIC table is mapped. the rest is 0s.
rest of the bits of this register are reserved.
to relocate the APIC table you can write to the base address field. note here that while every CPU has its own local APIC,
they all start pointing to the same APIC table. it's a must to relocate the APIC tables per processor in case of multiprocessor
environments.

## Configuring the LAPIC
the LVT is what allows configuring the interrupt sources. this happens via writing to specific LAPIC registers. all registers first
eight bits specify the vector number (hence LVT). this vector number is the number used to index into the IDT. the rest of the bits
define the interrupt delivery mechanisms. look into intel manual Vol3 Table 11-8

### Error handling
the Error status register (ESR) must be written to, to rearm the error functionalities of the APIC and to update the ESR before
reading from it.

### APIC Timer
LAPIC contains timer functionality. there is two important modes we care about, one shot mode and period mode.
Divide configuration register is used to divide the frequency of the PC clock and the generated number is the new frequency for
the interrupt. You configure the timer vector and mode by writing to the timer LVT register. to start the timer you need to write
to the initial timer count register.

## IVT
This is the interrupt table that exists in real mode. The BIOS sets this table up. This is a 4 byte per table entry
table where each entry has 2 bytes.
referencing segment and 2 bytes referencing offset, both mark the address of the routine to run when this interrupt
happens. These are the routines that run when we do for example int 15h in real mode.

## IDT
TODO: fill in the IDT documentation with every interrupt implementation design.

# ACPI
advanced configuration an power management interface. not a hardware spec. not a software spec. it's an interface definition for dealing
with a devices. it is not specific to a certain type of computer.
it's not the only way to interface with devices. the other way would be for the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to provide their
own driver for each OS, or a nice developer implementing the driver based on hardware spec which will be a pain in the arse. this is
called the legacy mode.

## overview
ACPI is a standard that allows OS to:
* enumerate connected devices to the system
* manage the devices functionality
* control the power states of the connected device
it is the OS's interface to deal with PCI devices, a middle man between devices and OS.
The ACPI does this via a group of tables. these tables are called definition and control objects.

## terminologies

* definition blocks: a logical area in memory containing control methods as defined by OEM.
* namespace: a logical grouping of a device functionality.
* ACPI Namespace: a tree like structure of namespaces.

a full list of terminologies exists in ACPI specs section 2.1

## how it works
ACPI Source Language compiler (ASL) compiles objects and control method to machine byte code (this happens on OEM side) and then ACPI Machine Language interpreter (AML) interprets it (happens in OS).
AML evaluates code in definition blocks
all of the above exists in a namespace. An object with _HID object can be managed by ACPI (drivers loaded by ACPI)
an object with _AID (physical identification object) maps to a device with a firmware that knows how to manage itself without ACPI. ACPI can still manage those if needed.
ACPI has runtime model triggered on events like new device connected, temprature increasing, etc.

## ACPI initialization
during boot, device firmware does setup, init, and self test. after that it updates its information in the ACPI table as necessary. i.e, it writes its information in memory.
the OSPM (operating system power management) submodule or the ACPI submodule then parses these tables starting at root system description table (RSDT) that exists in
BEDA (bios extended data area, see memory_layout.txt) or in the area below the 1MB boundary. this table contains pointer to XSDT and FADT and other tables.

## RSDP
Root system description pointer contains two pointers, one to RSDT and one to XSDT
structure of this pointer is as the following: (Legend: name  size  offset  description)

Signature   8B   0    "RSD PTR " <- note the space at the end.
Checksum    1B   8    first 20 Bytes checksum and should be zero
OEMID       6B   9    OEM ID supplied
Revision    1B   15   The Revision of the ACPI. if zero this is ACPI V1
RSDT        4B   16   Pointer to RSDT in memory
Length      4B   20   Length of RSDT Table. Not available in ACPI V1
XSDT Addr   8B   24   Pointer to XSDT Addr. Not available in ACPI V1
Checksum    1B   32   Checksum of the entire table. Not available in ACPI V1
Reserved    3B   33   Reserved bits. Not available in ACPI V1

## System Description Table
All the rest of the system description tables have their metadata in system description header. this table has the following structure
Signature        4B 0   Identifier for the table see table 5.5 in UEFI ACPI spec
Length           4B 4   Table length in bytes
Revision         1B 8   Revision
Checksum         1B 9   Entire table. must add to zero
OEMID            6B 10
OEM Table id     8B 16  OEM Supplied string ID used to identify particular data tables
OEM Revision     4B 24
Creator id       4B 28  Vendor id
Creator revision 4B 32 revision for ASL Compiler

## RSDT
Page 104 for the complete table structure ACPI UEFI Spec Doc.
This table is used in ACPI V1. if ACPI V2 is used the XSDT supersedes RSDT.

## XSDT
Page 105 for the complete table structure. used when ACPI V2 is used.
note the 64 bit addresses in this table rather than the 32 bits.

in both of the above tables, there is an array of addresses that point to other system description tables below.

## FADT
fixed ACPI description table constains addressed for important memory mapped hardware registers. page 106 for complete table structure.


## DSDT
deferentiated system definition table is the begining of the namespace and contains the definition blocks.

## MADT
Multi apic definition table.

## OS
* section 1.7.2 specifies the requirements to be implemented by the OS to be ACPI complient. section 1.7.3 contains the minimum requirements.

## main components of ACPI
Three components:
* ACPI System Description tables: the system tables that contains the definition blocks and pesudo code that can be interpreted by the OS. OSPM component in the OS contains an interpreter for this code
this code contains procedures that can be executed defined by the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to manage some functionality of the device.
* ACPI registers: hardware interface.
* ACPI platform firmware: code that initializes, sets up, restarts, sleeps, wake, etc. it is called during init of the PC.

## QBeKern ACPI
much like an OS for any IA32 Arch QBeKern will be ACPI Complient. during bootstrap of the system QBeKern will:
* Search for the Root System Description Pointer (RDSP) in the EBDA. if not found, will search in the
motherboard BIOS area. if not boot will fail.
* if booting in EFI, QBeKern will get a pointer to the RSDP from the EFI system tables.
* if ACPI V1 QBeKern uses RSDT, else use XSDT
* then QBeKern will parse the following table structures:
-- FADT
-- MADT

Note: this is the begining. The topic of power management and interfacing with other components is a very complicated and time consuming work.
While this is exciting in itself, there are more important and exciting as much topics to tackle first in kernel. this is a nice feature to implement towards the end.
Hence, I will only parse the basic tables to figure out more info about the processors and then stop. this includes FADT and MADT.

the architecture of the code will be as the following:
* in src/includes acpi.h will define the acpi subsystem external interface.
* in src/acpi/includes include files will only be related to internal acpi management.
* in src/acpi all implementation goes here.

# multiprocessing
this section deals with running multiprocessors together.

## MP Bootprotocol
One of the logical processors is selected as the bootstrap processor (BSP) and the others are marked as application processors (AP).
This configuration is defined in the APIC tables. The BSP executes MP initialization code and boots the OS. The AP executes minimal
initialization code until it recieves a self inter processor interrupt message (SIPI) which ends up with the processor in HALT state
and ready to be interrupted.

// placeholder for now
processor initialization should happen before system interrupts are enabled???
