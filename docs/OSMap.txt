# Overview

this is the entry point for QBeKern (qbk for short) documenttation.
it contains a lot of the design assumptions that are made and an explaination of
why things are made like this.
it contains a description of the fs of the project and artifacts made by the
build and their formats.

# QBeKern
A 32 bit kernel supports running on IA32 x86 arch processors.
Implementing a fully fledged OS is hard. hence, the target of this project is to
build a somewhat POSIX compliant kernel that can be a drop in kernel in a gnu
based distribution. After which QBeD (aka. QBeOS) will be a thing.  

# QBeKern components and dir structure
QBeKern kernel (QBeKern) : /src : c++
QBeKern bootloader (QBeL) : /boot : assembly NASM

QBeKern supports booting via an iso CD and ISO 9660 will be the first
"semi-supported" fs.
This allows 2046 bytes bootloader;
